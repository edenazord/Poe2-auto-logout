PoE2SA
PoE2SA is a lightweight tool for Path of Exile players that automatically exits or takes action when your in-game life or mana levels drop below a set threshold. The program continuously monitors your screen for your life and mana orbs and, when the fill percentage falls under a user-defined level, it simulates a key press (Esc or F9) to help protect you from dangerous situations.
